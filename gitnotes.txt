Version Control: Git tracks changes, not just files. Committing creates a snapshot of the file’s state.

Staging Area: Allows you to review and control which changes are included in the commit.

⚠️ Merge Conflicts
If both branches have changed the same part of a file, Git will ask you to resolve the conflict manually. You’ll edit the file, remove the conflict markers, then commit the resolved version.
git checkout main
git merge feature
# resolve conflicts if any
git commit   # if needed




A merge conflict happens when Git can’t figure out how to combine changes from two branches automatically. This usually happens when:

Two people (or branches) edited the same lines in a file.

A file was deleted in one branch and edited in another.




<<<<<<< HEAD
This is the version from your current branch (e.g., main).
=======
This is the version from the branch you're merging in (e.g., feature).
>>>>>>> feature


How to Fix It
Open the file and decide what the final version should be.

Delete the conflict markers and unwanted code.

Save the file.

Add it to the staging area:
